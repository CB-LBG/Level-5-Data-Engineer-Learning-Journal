Objectives
    • Understand the limitations of the Waterfall project management model in data projects.
    • Learn how Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban) improve data project outcomes.
    • Explore the integration of Lean and Six Sigma principles for process optimization.
    • Understand key roles in Agile Scrum, such as Scrum Master and Product Owner.
    • Learn how to apply iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability in data-driven initiatives.
    • Gain insights into stakeholder engagement and aligning data projects with business objectives.
    • Review real-world case studies and best practices for implementing Agile in data engineering.

Key Concepts
1. Challenges of Traditional Waterfall Project Management
    • Rigid and linear approach: Sequential steps (requirements → design → development → testing → deployment).
    • Limited adaptability: Difficult to accommodate evolving project needs.
    • Delayed feedback cycles: Stakeholder input often arrives too late.
    • Complexity in data projects: Inflexible models struggle with unstructured data, real-time changes, and continuous integration.
2. Agile Methodologies in Data Projects
    • Agile core values:
        ◦ Adaptability: Responding quickly to changes.
        ◦ Iterative development: Breaking work into smaller cycles (sprints).
        ◦ Collaboration: Engaging stakeholders early and frequently.
        ◦ Delivering incremental value: Ensuring continuous improvements.
    • Scrum vs. Kanban:
        ◦ Scrum: Structured sprints (1-4 weeks), with roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner.
        ◦ Kanban: Focuses on visual workflow, limiting work in progress to avoid bottlenecks.
3. Key Roles in Agile Scrum
    • Scrum Master: Facilitates Agile processes, removes blockers, ensures collaboration.
    • Product Owner: Manages backlog, prioritizes work, and aligns project goals with business needs.
    • Development Team: Engineers, analysts, and stakeholders working collaboratively.
4. Agile Practices in Data Engineering
    • User Stories & Sprint Planning: Define tasks, estimate efforts (e.g., using Story Points).
    • Sprint Reviews & Retrospectives:
        ◦ Sprint Review: Demonstrating completed work to stakeholders.
        ◦ Sprint Retrospective: Reflecting on processes to improve efficiency.
    • Backlog Grooming: Continuous refinement of task priorities to prevent scope creep.
    • Burn-down Charts: Visual tracking of sprint progress.
5. Lean & Six Sigma in Data Projects
    • Lean: Eliminating waste, focusing on value-driven workflows.
    • Six Sigma: Improving data quality and reducing errors using DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).

    'YearsSinceLastPromotion': The value '0' is ambiguous and could mean either a recent promotion or no promotion at all.

    'Over18' and 'OverTime': The 'Over18' column is redundant as it contains only 'Y', while 'OverTime' is useful but highlights the redundancy of 'Over18'.

    'MonthlyIncome' and 'MonthlyRate': Potential issues include inconsistencies, outliers, and unclear definitions.

    'EmployeeNumber': Validation should focus on uniqueness, completeness, format consistency, and referential integrity.

Think of a venv as a disposable, isolated toolbox specifically for this one project.

Without a venv: If you install a library (like pandas) directly on your computer, it installs it globally. If Project A needs pandas version 1.0 and Project B needs pandas version 2.0, they will conflict and one project will break.

With a venv: You create a mini-installation of Python just for this folder. Whatever libraries you install here stay inside this folder. They don't touch your main computer's system, and they don't mess up other projects.

n f-string (formatted string literal) in Python allows you to embed variables or expressions directly inside a string using {}. Introduced in Python 3.6, it offers a concise and readable alternative to str.format() and % formatting.

python -m venv venv

got to venv

cd venv

got back - deactivate

An f-string (formatted string literal) in Python allows you to embed variables or expressions directly inside a string using {}

Example:

name = "Alice"
score = 95
print(f"Hello {name}, your score is {score}.")
# Output: Hello Alice, your score is 95

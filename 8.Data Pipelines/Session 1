#### **Objectives**
*   Understand the limitations of traditional **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes and explore modern alternatives like ELT, streaming, and data federation.
*   Learn to build a foundational **data pipeline MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** using Python and pandas.
*   Develop practical skills in **data cleaning and validation**, including handling missing values, standardizing formats, and fixing data quality issues.
*   Implement **data transformation functions** for sensitive data handling (hashing), date correction, and string cleaning.
*   Prepare cleaned data for loading into a **SQL database** as the final pipeline destination.

#### **Key Concepts**

**1. ETL vs. Modern Data Integration**
*   **Traditional ETL:**
    *   Batch-oriented processing on a schedule (hourly/daily)
    *   Transform data *before* loading into a data warehouse
    *   Limitations: Not real-time, rigid architecture, struggles with unstructured data, scaling challenges
*   **Modern Alternatives:**
    *   **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):** Load raw data first, transform later in the destination
    *   **Streaming Pipelines:** Real-time data processing (like conveyor belt vs. postal truck)
    *   **Data Federation/Virtualization:** Querying data from multiple sources without moving it
    *   **Data Blending:** Combining different data sources for specific analyses

**2. Pipeline Architecture Patterns**
*   **Point-to-Point:** Direct connections between systems (simple but doesn't scale)
*   **Hub-and-Spoke:** Centralized management with everything connecting to a central server
*   **Distributed/Bus Architecture:** Central stream where data flows (highly scalable but complex)

**3. Data Quality & Governance**
*   **Key Dimensions:** Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Validity, Uniqueness, Timeliness
*   **Importance:** Poor data leads to flawed insights and business risks
*   **Tools:** Great Expectations, Monte Carlo for automated validation and monitoring
*   **Governance:** Data lineage, schema validation, access control, logging

**4. Practical Pipeline Development**
*   **Modular Approach:** Breaking pipeline into small, reusable functions
*   **Common Data Issues Handled:**
    *   **Column Cleaning:** Standardizing names (lowercase, underscores), removing whitespace
    *   **Missing Values:** Handling blanks, dashes, "N/A", "null" consistently
    *   **Data Type Conversion:** Fixing dates, numbers, and categorical data
    *   **Sensitive Data:** Hashing passwords using SHA-256
    *   **Data Validation:** Checking date logic (e.g., birth dates not in future)
*   **Transformation Functions:**
    *   `clean_columns()`: Standardize column names
    *   `hash_password()`: Securely hash sensitive data
    *   `clean_dob()`: Fix date of birth inconsistencies
    *   `clean_salary()`: Remove formatting and extract numeric values

**5. Tool Ecosystem**
*   **Kafka:** Streaming platform for real-time data
*   **Airflow:** Workflow orchestration and scheduling
*   **NiFi:** Data ingestion and distribution
*   **dbt:** Transformation and data quality in the data warehouse

#### **Questions**
*   In the Spotify case study, why would a traditional ETL approach be insufficient for providing real-time song recommendations to users?
*   What are the key differences between **hashing** and **encryption**, and why is hashing more appropriate for storing passwords in a database?
*   When cleaning the date of birth column, what logic would you implement to handle cases where someone's birth year appears to be in the future (e.g., 2065 instead of 1965)?
*   How does the **modular function approach** demonstrated in the practical session make the pipeline more maintainable and testable compared to writing all transformations in a single script?
*   What are the advantages of using **regular expressions** (regex) for cleaning data like salary fields, and what potential pitfalls should you watch for?
*   Why is it important to establish a consistent **missing values policy** (e.g., converting blanks, dashes, and "N/A" to standard NaN values) early in the pipeline development?
*   In the context of data governance, how would you implement **data lineage tracking** to understand where your user data originated and what transformations were applied?

# 📚 Level 5 Data Engineer Learning Journal

## 🌟 Overview and Purpose

It is a documentation of my practical experience, knowledge gained, project work, and personal reflections aligned with the apprenticeship curriculum and the **Data Engineer (Level 5)** standard.

### Repository Structure
The journal is organized into modules/folders reflecting the core areas of data engineering practice, ensuring all competencies required for the End-Point Assessment (EPA) are logged and demonstrable.

Please include a paragraph on what specific learning activity the above relates to on your learning plan? August was an intensive month covering Cloud Engineering, Data Collection, and Advanced Python. Key activities included Portfolio Task 2 and learning about CI/CD pipelines. This relates to K8 (Cloud Systems), S4 (Automating Pipelines), and K29 (Technological Developments).

Explain what learning you undertook and how you will or have applied this in the workplace? I undertook a broad range of training this month, including the "Cloud Engineering" module and "Power BI with GitHub: CI/CD Pipelines". I explored how to automate the deployment of reports and code using continuous integration tools. I also completed "Data Collection and Ingestion 1", focusing on gathering data from diverse sources. I have applied this by setting up a basic CI/CD workflow for our Power BI reports, ensuring that version control is maintained and changes are tested before reaching production. Additionally, the Cloud Engineering insights helped me better understand our cloud resource consumption, allowing me to suggest cost-saving measures by shutting down idle development environments.

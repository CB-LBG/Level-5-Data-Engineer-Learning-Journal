Please include a paragraph on what specific learning activity the above relates to on your learning plan? This month I focused on practical coding skills through Python for Non-Programmers and completed Portfolio Task 1. These activities map to S1 (Programming) and S29 (Personal Strategies), developing the foundational scripting skills required for data engineering tasks and demonstrating the ability to apply learning to real-world scenarios.

Explain what learning you undertook and how you will or have applied this in the workplace? I undertook a structured Python course to build my scripting confidence, covering variables, loops, and functions. Simultaneously, I worked on Portfolio Task 1, which required me to synthesize the knowledge gained from previous modules into a cohesive project. I have applied this learning by identifying repetitive manual tasks in our daily data checks that can be automated. Using the Python skills I practiced, I have started writing simple scripts to parse CSV files automatically, reducing the time spent on manual entry. Completing the portfolio task also helped me structure my documentation better, ensuring that my code and workflows are understandable to other team members.

python -m venv venv

Can be done be selecting python interpreter (Python only use code above for conda)

1. What is a venv (Virtual Environment)?
Think of a venv as a disposable, isolated toolbox specifically for this one project.

Without a venv: If you install a library (like pandas) directly on your computer, it installs it globally. If Project A needs pandas version 1.0 and Project B needs pandas version 2.0, they will conflict and one project will break.

With a venv: You create a mini-installation of Python just for this folder. Whatever libraries you install here stay inside this folder. They don't touch your main computer's system, and they don't mess up other projects.

Key Concept: The venv folder is disposable. You should be able to delete the entire venv folder, run a command to create a fresh one, install your requirements, and be back up and running in minutes. It should not contain any of your actual work.

Objectives
    • Understand the importance of data quality and its impact on decision-making.
    • Learn about data standards and governance principles for ensuring data integrity.
    • Identify key data quality metrics such as accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.
    • Explore common file types (CSV, JSON, XML) and their associated challenges.
    • Learn how to apply the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) to data management.
    • Understand data validation techniques to ensure reliability and consistency.

Key Concepts
1. Data Quality & Governance
    • Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO): Poor-quality data leads to inaccurate insights.
    • Role of Data Engineers: Gatekeepers of data quality; responsible for cleaning and maintaining structured datasets.
    • Key Data Quality Metrics:
        ◦ Accuracy: Reflects real-world values correctly.
        ◦ Completeness: No missing or null data where information is required.
        ◦ Consistency: Ensures uniformity across different datasets.
        ◦ Timeliness: Data is up-to-date and refreshed as required.
        ◦ Reliability: Ensures data remains trustworthy over time.
2. Data Standards & FAIR Principles
    • FAIR Principles:
        ◦ Findability: Using metadata, indexing, and unique identifiers.
        ◦ Accessibility: Secure role-based access controls.
        ◦ Interoperability: Data formats (CSV, JSON, XML) and consistent schema structures.
        ◦ Reusability: Standardized metadata descriptions and data governance.
    • Data Catalogs & Dictionaries: Used for organizing and documenting metadata.
3. Common Data Quality Issues & Fixes
    • Inconsistent Formatting: Different date formats, missing headers, or incorrect delimiters.
    • Encoding Errors: Issues with special characters (UTF-8 standard recommended).
    • Data Duplication: Implementing validation checks and unique identifiers.
    • Schema Validation: Ensuring data follows predefined structures for compatibility. Schema - structure of the data/table, data dictionary provides info about the data  

4. File Types & Considerations
    • CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
        ◦ Simple, portable, widely used.
        ◦ Issues: Lacks structure, inconsistent delimiters, data type mismatches.
    • JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
        ◦ Human-readable, key-value format.
        ◦ Issues: Complex nesting, large files affect performance.
    • XML (Extensible Markup Language)
        ◦ Structured, widely used in data exchange.
        ◦ Issues: Parsing errors, improper tag structures.

A summary of the key learning points from this topic is provided below.


There are two main categories of data types: qualitative (nominal, ordinal, binomial) and quantitative (discrete, continuous)

Data is measured using standardised units ranging from bits to yottabytes, with each larger unit being 1,024 times bigger than the previous one

Important technological standards for data engineering include data formats like JSON, CSV, XML, API standards like REST and OpenAPI Specification, and cloud computing standards like AWS Well-Architected Framework

Key regulations governing data include GDPR for data privacy, HIPAA for healthcare data security, and CCPA for consumer privacy rights

The three fundamental principles of data stewardship are data quality, data governance, and data ethics

Engineering best practices for data systems include scalability, reliability, security, performance optimisation, and documentation

The data management lifecycle involves collecting data from sources, cleaning/transforming data, integrating datasets, and visualising insights using tools like SQL, Power BI, and Tableau

Combining internal data with external open data, administrative data, research data, and third-party sources enriches insights for better decision-making

# 📚 Level 5 Data Engineer Learning Journal

## 🌟 Overview and Purpose

This repository serves as my official **Learning Journal and portfolio** for the **Level 5 Data Engineer Apprenticeship**.

It is a documentation of my practical experience, knowledge gained, project work, and personal reflections aligned with the apprenticeship curriculum and the **Data Engineer (Level 5)** standard.

### Repository Structure
The journal is organized into modules/folders reflecting the core areas of data engineering practice, ensuring all competencies required for the End-Point Assessment (EPA) are logged and demonstrable.

* `./01_Core_Concepts/`: Notes, definitions, and foundational knowledge (e.g., Data Architecture, Ethics, Governance).
* `./02_SQL_Data_Modelling/`: SQL scripts, data modeling diagrams, and database practice.
* `./03_Python_ETL/`: Python scripts for data manipulation (Pandas), scripting, and basic ETL/ELT processes.
* `./04_Data_Pipelines_Orchestration/`: Code and configurations for building, automating, and monitoring data workflows (e.g., Airflow, Azure Data Factory).
* `./05_Cloud_Infrastructure/`: Notes and setup scripts (IaC) related to cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP) for data solutions.
* `./06_Capstone_Project/`: The final, significant project used for EPA preparation (e.g., building a complete, end-to-end data platform).
* `./Documentation/`: Technical documentation, requirements gathering, and professional discussion preparation.

## 🛠️ Key Skills and Technologies Demonstrated

This journal documents hands-on mastery in the following core areas:

### 1. Programming & Data Processing
* **Python:** Advanced scripting, data manipulation with **Pandas/Numpy**, and software development best practices (testing, version control).
* **SQL:** Complex queries, stored procedures, performance tuning, and database administration (DDL/DML).
* **PySpark/Scala (Optional):** Working with distributed computing frameworks for Big Data processing.

### 2. Data Infrastructure & Storage
* **Data Modelling:** Relational (3NF/Dimensional) and NoSQL modeling for different use cases.
* **Data Warehousing:** Concepts of Data Lakes, Data Lakehouses, and Data Marts (e.g., Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric).
* **Cloud Platforms:** Implementation of data solutions using **[AWS / Azure / GCP]** services (e.g., S3/Blob Storage, EC2/VMs, RDS/Managed Databases).

### 3. Data Flow & Automation (ETL/ELT)
* **Pipeline Tools:** Building and managing robust data pipelines using tools like **Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or similar orchestrators**.
* **Streaming:** Experience with batch, micro-batch, and real-time streaming concepts (e.g., Kafka, Azure Stream Analytics).

### 4. Software Engineering & DevOps
* **Version Control:** Professional usage of **Git** and **GitHub** for collaborative development.
* **Containerization:** Introduction to **Docker** for dependency management and reproducible environments.
* **CI/CD:** Implementing basic Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment for data pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).

        ◦ The session focused on building a data-driven culture within organizations.
        ◦ Key elements of a data-driven culture include:
            ▪ Clean, usable data
            ▪ Data governance and quality
            ▪ Data stewardship and responsibility
            ▪ Data literacy across the organization
            ▪ Collaboration and stakeholder buy-in
            ▪ Executive support and data strategy

Data Engineering Role
        ◦ Data engineers play a crucial role in enabling businesses to harness the power of big data.
        ◦ They design, build, and maintain infrastructure and systems for data collection, storage, and processing.
        ◦ Data engineers ensure data quality and reliability, which is essential for data-driven decision-making.
Big Data vs. Small Data
        ◦ Big Data: Characterized by high volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value. Examples include social media platforms analyzing billions of user interactions daily.
        ◦ Small Data: Smaller in volume, often structured, and easier to analyze. Examples include personal fitness trackers recording daily steps and calories.
Data Formats and Standards
        ◦ Common data formats include JSON, CSV, and XML.
        ◦ Cloud computing standards like AWS Well-Architected Framework and OpenAPI Specification were discussed.
        ◦ Regulatory requirements such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and ISO 27001 (Information Security Management) were highlighted.
Best Practices in Data Engineering
    • Scalability and Reliability
        ◦ Data systems must handle growing data volumes without sacrificing performance.
        ◦ Redundancy and disaster recovery plans are essential for safeguarding data.
    • Data Documentation
        ◦ Proper documentation ensures that data is understandable and usable by others.
    • Data Ethics
        ◦ Ethical guidelines must be followed to ensure responsible data usage.
Activity: Employee Churn Decision Tree
    • Objective: Build a decision tree for predicting employee churn.
    • Key Factors Identified:
        ◦ Salary
        ◦ Job satisfaction
        ◦ Work hours

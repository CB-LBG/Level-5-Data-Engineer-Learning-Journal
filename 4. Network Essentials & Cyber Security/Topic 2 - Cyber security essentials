#### **Objectives**  
1. Understand the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and its role in cybersecurity.  
2. Differentiate between **symmetric** and **asymmetric encryption**, including use cases and trade-offs.  
3. Explain how **digital signatures**, **certificate authorities (CAs)**, and **hashing** enforce data integrity and authentication.  
4. Identify common cyber threats (e.g., phishing, DDoS, data tampering) and map them to CIA principles.  
5. Explore practical security controls (e.g., firewalls, MFA, backups) and frameworks like **NIST**.

#### **Key Concepts**  
1. **CIA Triad**:  
   - **Confidentiality**: Protect data from unauthorized access (e.g., encryption, access controls).  
   - **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and prevent tampering (e.g., hashing, digital signatures).  
   - **Availability**: Guarantee reliable access to systems/data (e.g., redundancy, backups).  
   - *Trade-offs*: Over-emphasizing one component (e.g., encryption) may impact usability or performance.  

2. **Encryption Methods**:  
   - **Symmetric Encryption**:  
     - Single shared key for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES-256).  
     - *Pros*: Fast, efficient for large data volumes.  
     - *Cons*: Key distribution risks; vulnerable if compromised.  
   - **Asymmetric Encryption**:  
     - Public/private key pairs (e.g., RSA).  
     - *Use cases*: Secure emails, website certificates (TLS/SSL).  
     - *Pros*: Enhanced security; enables digital signatures.  
     - *Cons*: Slower than symmetric encryption.  

3. **Data Integrity & Authentication**:  
   - **Hashing**: One-way function generating unique fixed-size outputs (e.g., SHA-256).  
     - Detects tampering (minor changes â†’ vastly different hash).  
     - *Collision risk*: Weak algorithms (e.g., MD5) allow duplicate hashes.  
   - **Digital Signatures**:  
     - Combine hashing + asymmetric encryption to verify sender identity and message integrity.  
     - Enabled by **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** (e.g., Globalsign) that issue trusted digital certificates.  

4. **Security Controls**:  
   - **Preventive**: Firewalls, MFA, role-based access control (RBAC).  
   - **Detective**: Audits, intrusion detection systems (IDS).  
   - **Corrective**: Backups, patch management, disaster recovery plans.  
   - **NIST Framework**: Standardized approach for risk assessment and security control implementation.  

5. **Threat Mitigation**:  
   - **Phishing**: Breaches confidentiality (training + email filters).  
   - **DDoS Attacks**: Targets availability (redundancy + cloud firewalls).  
   - **Data Overwriting**: Compromises integrity (version control + access audits).

#### **Questions for Review**  
1. **CIA Triad**:  
   - How does encrypting patient records in a hospital system uphold *confidentiality*? What trade-offs might arise?  
   - Why might a DDoS attack violate *availability* but not directly impact *integrity*?  

2. **Encryption & Keys**:  
   - When would you choose symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption for a cloud-based payment system? Justify your answer.  
   - How do certificate authorities (CAs) prevent "man-in-the-middle" attacks during website transactions?  

3. **Integrity Mechanisms**:  
   - Explain how a changed hash value reveals data tampering. Why is SHA-3 more secure than MD5?  
   - In the GP practice scenario, how could digital signatures prevent fraudulent prescription alterations?  

4. **Practical Applications**:  
   - What security controls would you implement to protect against accidental data overwriting in a shared database?  
   - How does homomorphic encryption (mentioned in the medical example) balance confidentiality with data usability?  

5. **Threat Response**:  
   - If a phishing attack exposes patient emails, what steps should the GP clinic take to restore confidentiality?  
   - Why is geographic redundancy critical for maintaining availability during a natural disaster?

**Additional Notes**:  
- **AWS Academy**: Highlighted as a sandbox environment for practicing cloud security skills (e.g., configuring security groups, KMS encryption).  
- **Session Tools**: Online encryption/hashing demos (e.g., AES, SHA-256) reinforced theoretical concepts.  
- **Group Activities**: Focused on mapping threats (phishing/DDoS/data overwriting) to CIA principles and mitigation strategies.  
- **Next Steps**: Review NIST framework details and cyber-risk cost analysis (covered in subsequent sessions).  

> ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway**: The CIA triad provides a foundational lens for evaluating security risks. Effective cybersecurity balances technical controls (encryption, hashing) with human factors (training, access policies).

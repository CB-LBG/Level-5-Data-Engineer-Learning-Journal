The Skeleton (Order of Execution)
SQL code is written in one order but executed in another:
FROM & JOIN (Gather data)
WHERE (Filter rows)
GROUP BY (Aggregate)
HAVING (Filter aggregates)
SELECT (Return columns)
ORDER BY (Sort)
LIMIT / TOP (Restrict count)
Joins
INNER JOIN: Matches only. Rows must exist in both tables.
LEFT JOIN: All rows from left table, matching rows from right. (Nulls on right if no match).
FULL OUTER JOIN: Everything from both tables.
Aggregations
COUNT(*): Count rows.
COUNT(DISTINCT col): Count unique values.
SUM(col), AVG(col), MIN(col), MAX(col).
Golden Rule: If you use an aggregate, every non-aggregated column must be in the GROUP BY clause.
Conditional Logic (Case When)
The "If statement" of SQL.

SQL


SELECT 
    order_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN amount > 100 THEN 'High Value'
        WHEN amount > 50 THEN 'Medium Value'
        ELSE 'Low Value'
    END AS order_category
FROM orders;


Set Operations
UNION: Stacks results from two queries (removes duplicates).
UNION ALL: Stacks results (keeps duplicates—faster).

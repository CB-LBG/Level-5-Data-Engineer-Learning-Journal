Please include a paragraph on what specific learning activity the above relates to on your learning plan? This month’s activity covered Networks Essentials and Cyber Security. This is critical for K7 (Data Security) and S6 (Compliance), ensuring that I understand the infrastructure that supports our data and the security protocols required to protect it.

Explain what learning you undertook and how you will or have applied this in the workplace? I completed the Networks Essentials and Cyber Security training, which covered the OSI model, IP addressing, and common cyber threats like SQL injection and phishing. I also learned about encryption standards and secure data transmission protocols. I applied this in the workplace by participating in a review of our database access controls. I was able to identify potential vulnerabilities where permissions were too broad and suggested implementing tighter IP allow-listing for our cloud database instances. This directly contributes to maintaining the integrity and security of the data assets I am responsible for managing.

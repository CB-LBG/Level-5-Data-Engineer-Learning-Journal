Focus: Teradata specific syntax, performance optimization, and unique functions.

Unique Keywords
QUALIFY: Filters Window Functions immediately (avoids subqueries).
Usage: SELECT * FROM table QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY date DESC) = 1
SAMPLE: Returns a random set of rows.
Usage: SELECT * FROM table SAMPLE 100;
SAMPLE 0: Creates a table structure without data.
Usage: CREATE TABLE new AS old WITH DATA AND STATISTICS SAMPLE 0;
HELP / SHOW: Metadata inspection.
Usage: HELP TABLE db.table; (attributes) or SHOW TABLE db.table; (DDL).
Volatile Tables (Temporary)
Crucial: Always use ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS or the table will be empty.
Syntax:
SQL
CREATE VOLATILE TABLE vt_temp AS (
    SELECT col1, col2 FROM source_table
) WITH DATA 
PRIMARY INDEX (col1) 
ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS;


Date Handling
Current: CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
Arithmetic: * date_col + 7 (add days)
ADD_MONTHS(date_col, 1) (add months)
Formatting: CAST(date_col AS CHAR(10) FORMAT 'DD/MM/YYYY')
String Helpers
Concat: col1 || col2
Substring: SUBSTR(col, start_pos, length)
Index: INDEX(col, 'string_to_find') (Returns position number)
Trim: TRIM(BOTH FROM col)
Performance (The Primary Index)
Teradata is a parallel system; it distributes data across processors based on the Primary Index (PI).
Skew: Occurs when one processor has too much data because the PI has low variance (e.g., PI on 'Gender'). This kills performance.
Best Practice: Always Join on Primary Index columns.

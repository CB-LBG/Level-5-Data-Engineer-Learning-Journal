Green Belt Course Learning Notes
Day 1: Introduction to Lean Six Sigma & Define Phase

    Organizational Culture in Change Management

        Success depends on trust, sustainability, inclusivity, and boldness.

        People-first approach ensures continuous improvement (CI) adoption.

    Lean vs. Six Sigma

        Lean: Eliminates waste (Toyota Production System).

        Six Sigma: Reduces variation (Motorola).

        Lean Sigma: Combines both for efficiency and quality.

    DMAIC Framework

        Define: Problem, scope, goals (Project Charter).

        Measure: Baseline data, process mapping.

        Analyze: Root cause analysis.

        Improve: Solution testing.

        Control: Sustain gains.

    Tools & Techniques

        SIPOC Diagram: High-level process mapping (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers).

        In/Out of Frame: Clarifies project scope.

        Stakeholder Management: Engage early to avoid resistance.

Day 2: Measure Phase – Data & Process Analysis

    Customer Requirements (CTQ Trees)

        Translate vague needs into measurable Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) metrics.

        Example: "Efficient airport transit" → Measurable transit time.

    Measurement Plan

        Define Y (output) and X (input) metrics.

        Use operational definitions for consistency.

    Data Types

        Continuous: Time, weight.

        Discrete: Defect counts.

    Tools & Techniques

        Fishbone Diagram: Identify root causes (e.g., airport delays).

        Process Mapping: Visualize current state (e.g., check-in → boarding).

        MSA (Gauge R&R): Assess measurement system variation.

        Process Yields: First-pass vs. rolled throughput yield.

Day 3: Analyze Phase – Root Causes & Statistics

    Statistics Basics

        Standard Deviation (σ): Measures data spread.

            Sample: STDEV.S; Population: STDEVP.

        Normal Distribution: 68% (±1σ), 95% (±2σ), 99% (±3σ).

    Process Analysis

        Traffic Light Technique:

            Green: Value-adding.

            Amber: Necessary non-value-adding.

            Red: Waste.

        TIM WOOD: 7 wastes (Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects).

    Root Cause Analysis

        5 Whys: Drill down to root cause.

        Fishbone Diagram: Validate hypotheses with data.

    Idea Generation

        Brainstorming: Mind maps, negative brainstorming.

        Prioritization:

            PACE Matrix: Ease vs. benefit.

            Pugh Matrix: Compare solutions.

Day 4: Improve & Control Phases

    Improvement Phase

        Pilot Testing: Small-scale trials.

        FMEA: Proactively identify failure modes.

    Control Phase

        Control Plans: Document new processes.

        Control Charts: Monitor stability (X-bar R, I-MR).

        SOPs: Standardize improvements.

    Post-Implementation

        Stop/Start/Continue: Review lessons learned.

        Recognize Contributors: Celebrate team efforts.

Exam Preparation (Day 5)

    Format: 30 MCQs, 90% pass, 45 minutes.

    Focus Areas:

        DMAIC stages & tools.

        Statistical concepts (σ, normal distribution).

        Case study applications (e.g., airport check-in).

Key Takeaways

    Define: Clearly outline the problem.

    Measure: Collect good data.

    Analyze: Find root causes.

    Improve: Test solutions.

    Control: Lock in gains.
